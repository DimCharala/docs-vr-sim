The car models of the ai drivers are part of the lower poly model pack Background Cars by Iyoshko. These cars are using an AI Controller, which contains the main functions and calculations of each car, and box colliders. Currently all the AI cars are spawned at the start of the game, meaning there is no dynamic spawning/despawning of cars.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"ai-cars/#actions","title":"Actions","text":"<p>These are the main functions of each car in more detail.</p>"},{"location":"ai-cars/#automatic-movement","title":"Automatic Movement","text":"<p>The movement of each car is done using splines, which exist in each road. More specifically all of the roads in the application contain spline components and collision boxes. After a car hits a collision box, it is assigned a new spline which is the new movement direction. The throttle, brake, steering inputs are calculated using the current position of the car in the spline and an estimated next position.</p>"},{"location":"ai-cars/#obstacle-detection","title":"Obstacle Detection","text":"<p>Each car has a box collider in the front of it, which changes its shape depending on the speed of the vehicle. An increase in the speed increases the size of the collider. Using this the car can detect obstacles in front of it, like other cars or pedestrians, and adjust its speed.</p>"},{"location":"ai-cars/#traffic-light-logic","title":"Traffic Light Logic","text":"<p>Traffic lights are important elements in the car logic. The traffic light constantly changes states during the simulation. In order for the car to know if it should stop at a traffic light a box collider is used in which any overlapping car checks the state of the traffic light. If it is green, the car moves. If it is yellow or red, the car stops.</p>"},{"location":"ai-cars/#next-steps","title":"Next steps","text":"<p>These are next addition to the project.

The 6 states are:</p> <ol> <li>Walking </li> <li>About to cross the road</li> <li>Waiting to cross the road</li> <li>Crossing the road</li> <li>Reached opposite side of the road</li> <li>Successfully crossed the road</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>The Walking state is the default state of the pedestrian AI. It's goal is for the pedestrian to move uninterupted to the target point. However if the pedestrian enters the hitbox of a traffic light, which means they want to cross, the enter the second state \"About to cross the road\". At that moment a check of the traffic light occurs to determine the next state. If the traffic light is green, they enter the fourth state \"Crossing the road\". However if it is red, they enter the third state \"Waiting to cross the road\". After the traffic light turns to green, the pedestrian enters the fourth state. Reaching the hitbox on the opposite side makes the pedestrians enter the fifth state with the same name and after they exit the hitbox, they reach the sixth state \"Successfully crossed the road\". The final step is reseting back to walking state, which occurs automatically.</p>"},{"location":"ai-pedestrian/#target-points","title":"Target Points","text":"<p>There are multiple random points inside the map, which are assigned randomly at the start of the simulation or when a pedestrian reaches one.

It uses Post Process Materials and an object detection function which uses octrees to display visible information for the windshield.

Using instances of these signs to inform and warn the driver for potential speed limits, stop warnings or traffic lights. To achieve this an octree containing all the traffic warnings and the obstacle warning, which will be explained in detail in the next segment, is initialized during the start of the simulation. This octree can be updated manually if a warning is deleted or added. </p> <p></p> <p>The position of these warnings is static, so the position of these should be manually placed or spawned using an external server with the information (and potentially websockets). </p>"},{"location":"ar-windshield/#obstacle-warnings","title":"Obstacle Warnings","text":"<p>This part refers mainly to static obstacles, like dips or bumps in the road. Using the same logic as with the traffic warnings, which is that the position of these should be manually places or spawned using an external server with information, they warn the driver about the obstacle and visualize the general area of the obstacle. As an example the dips require a radius of it (or at least an estimate) to visualize it using a circular warning on the ground.</p>"},{"location":"ar-windshield/#exceeding-speed-limit","title":"Exceeding Speed Limit","text":"<p>Using a custom widget, which changes the speed limit text, when a user is exceeding the speed limit of the road there is a small transparent warning displayed above the steering wheel. The speed limits is always updated after a change in the speed limit in a specific road. For example leaving a 30km/h area and entering a 50km/h area, will change the warning text too.</p>"},{"location":"ar-windshield/#colorblind-accessibility","title":"Colorblind Accessibility","text":"<p>It is important that the AR elements of the UI screen and especially the car warning to be noticable even for people with colorblindness.
