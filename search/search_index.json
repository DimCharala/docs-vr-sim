It uses Post Process Materials and Unreal Engine's Scene Capture Components. Specifically for the visualization of the danger levels of Cars and Pedestrians only Post Process Materials are needed, which use the depth buffer and Unreal Engine's Custom Depth Buffer, which is basically a depth buffer only for selected actors in the scene.</p>"},{"location":"ar-windshield/#details","title":"Details","text":"<p>AI Cars and Pedestrians</p> <p>The AI Cars and the Pedestrians are explained in more detail on their own page here.</p>"},{"location":"ar-windshield/#traffic-warnings","title":"Traffic Warnings","text":"<p>While driving the user has to pay attention to the traffic laws and to traffic sign indications. Using instances of these signs to inform and warn the driver for potential speed limits, stop warnings or traffic lights. The position of these warnings is static, so the position of these should be manually placed or spawned using an external server with the information (and potentially websockets).</p>"},{"location":"ar-windshield/#obstacle-warnings","title":"Obstacle Warnings","text":"<p>This part refers mainly to static obstacles, like dips or bumps in the road. Using the same logic as with the traffic warnings, which is that the position of these should be manually places or spawned using an external server with information, they warn the driver about the obstacle and visualize the general area of the obstacle. As an example the dips require a radius of it (or at least an estimate) to visualize it using a circular warning on the ground.</p>"},{"location":"ar-windshield/#next-steps","title":"Next steps","text":"<ul> <li>Fixing position of projected elements on VR</li> <li>Adding more traffic signs</li> <li>Connecting with data base</li> </ul>"},{"location":"codetest/","title":"Next Steps","text":"<p>Example</p> add_numbers.cpp<pre><code># Function to add two numbers\nint addition (int a, int b)\n{\n    return a+b;\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"content-tabs/","title":"Content tabs","text":""},{"location":"content-tabs/#content-tabs","title":"Content Tabs","text":"<p>This is some examples of content tabs.</p>"},{"location":"content-tabs/#generic-content","title":"Generic Content","text":"Plain textUnordered listOrdered list <p>This is some plain text</p> <ul> <li>First item</li> <li>Second item</li> <li>Third item</li> </ul> <ol> <li>First item</li> <li>Second item</li> <li>Third item</li> </ol>"},{"location":"content-tabs/#code-blocks-in-content-tabs","title":"Code Blocks in Content Tabs","text":"PythonJavaScript <pre><code>def main():\n    print(\"Hello world!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n</code></pre> <pre><code>function main() {\n    console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n}\n\nmain();\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"weather/","title":"Weather Implementation","text":"<p>There are different weather environments which can be used in the simulator, which will affect the visibility ranges of warning and obstacles.</p>"},{"location":"weather/#weather-states","title":"Weather states","text":"<ul> <li>Sunny or cloudy</li> <li>Rain using Easy Rain plugin</li> <li>Night</li> </ul>"},{"location":"weather/#sunnycloudy","title":"Sunny/cloudy","text":"<p>Both of these are the default state, when the driver has maximum visibility.

For example when they are behind buildings or multiple other cars.</p>"},{"location":"weather/#rain","title":"Rain","text":"<p>Currently this state uses the Easy Rain plugin, which creates rain particles, puddles and generally everything that is needed for a rainy scene's visuals.
